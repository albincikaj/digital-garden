When you start writing, you can write multiple ideas and then you have the possibility to arrange , articulate, and drop ideas. 

The person who can formulate and communicate the best arguments almost always wins.

When you learn to edit and write, you also become more capable to differentiate between good ideas that are well presented and bad ideas interpreted by unskilled thinkers. 

The further you climb to the latter of you career you climb the more important thinking and communicating becomes.

The better of a communicator you become the more you can defend yourself, or your friends and families.

The mind is organized verbally. So if you learn to think, through writing, then you will develop a well-organized, efficient mind.

Try to grab whatever time you have, even as little as 15 minutes a day. You won't get that big chunk of free time to start. Probably you won't get that free time ever in your life. So that you don't depend your success to things that doesn't exist

As a rule of thumb it is best to make a paragraph of at least 10 sentences or 100 words.

A paragraph should present a single idea, using multiple sentences.
If you can't come up with 100 words, you need to think more about it.
If you have e.g 300 words per paragraph then you probably have more than one idea.
