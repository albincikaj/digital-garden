Create a category for transcribing content you are consuming for example a video you are watching, book you are reading or other stuff. So when you capture everything that you need then you try to extract meaningful notes and put them into the zettlecasten method. 

The current method of capturing short notes is not that efficient as you tend to miss out some of the interesting information in the first place.

It would be better if we used the Resources to store that process and then extract knowledge from those processes.

The properties tab, even though provide more information they appear ugly on every note so a good idea would be to change the layout.
