##### The Word Bank
Is a list of the most robust words that are found in the vocabularies of history's greatest speakers.

Step 1: Select any 10$ word from the **Word Bank** resource (below). After researching its definition and reviewing pronunciation, write it down.  You can use google, dicitionary.com or any AI tool.

Step 2: Record a 3-minute soliloquy (a speech to yourself) using my new word. Use your camera or voice memo app to record yourself expressing your thoughts on a topic of interest to you. 

Step 3: Play back the recording and listen attentively to each word. This is the first step in bringing awareness to how you speak. The idea is to be familiar with how I construct your sentences, how I choose my words, what words I select, in building my thoughts.

*Tip*
What comes out of my mouth in the several minutes doesn't have to be an eloquent oration. Let the words be imperfect. Don't restart even if I find myself stuttering and stammering.
