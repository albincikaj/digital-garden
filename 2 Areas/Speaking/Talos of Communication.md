The telos of communication is to have others understand what we say.

Communication that fails to advance understanding is poor communication.

Words persuade, inspire and impact.
The amount of impact at our disposal is correlated to our mastery of the spoken word. 

My ability to understand someone else's emotions is limited to how they can communicate them.

#### Understanding Proper Communication:
1) Good communication is often hindered as much by the lack of words as by the excess of words
2) Bigger words aren't always the better words. The objective is understanding and I will not sacrifice clarity.
3)  Language is an ever-changing fabric requiring a pattern
