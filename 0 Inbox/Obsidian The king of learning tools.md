The idea is to create reusable notes so that you can use them anytime that you want

All the notes should go to zettlecasten folder so that we reuse them later instead of putting them in different folders.

Use the searchbar option Ctrl + O for creating a new note instead of just Ctrl + N so that when you are writing the name of the note you don't write the same note twice. Good idea.

When reading a book create a note with the name of the book,
- use the quotes from the book as a paragraph
- then try to expand those quotes from your perspective in another paragraph

Try to have a tag structure for you notes so that you can now if they need more refinement or they can be directly used. In the case of the YouTube video the creator uses the tags (baby, child, adult) to show the level of the note. The baby tag shows that the note need more care, the child can be used on other notes, the adult one shows that it can be used on other notes and to make essays with it.
