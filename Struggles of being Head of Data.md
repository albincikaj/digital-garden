This is a series of comments from people who have experience in being the only people in Data roles in a company.

1. Advices: 
	* learn from entrepreneurs, behavioral scientists and product managers and build the data domain like a startup

2. Lessons:
	- Start with the business: meet every team, understand their data needs, then align with your CEO to prioritize the first project.  
	- Focus on one project at a time: sequential > parallel. Otherwise, nothing gets done.  
	- Think small, but build end-to-end: start with a narrow scope, but ensure you deliver a complete data flow (from extraction to insights).  
	- Avoid early vendor lock-in: keep your options open and stay flexible.
3. Advice:
	*   If you can't hire someone, ask for a budget for consultants/contractors. If they are not serious about the role only testing the waters.
4. Advice:
	* Understand the goals and KPIs of your peer departments and execs (ops, sales, product, eng, etc..) and make sure the roadmap you plan brings value to their goals.  
	* Whatever you do it should set the other teams for success and they should be using your platform and analysis as the foundation to reach their goals
5. Joke:
	* If you're a well-accomplished chef and somebody hires you to cook, wash the dishes, wait tables and run the entire place at the same time you're probably in the wrong kitchen
6. Advice:
	* In the end, it is always about business value - be relentlessly focused on delivering immediate value.
	* Bonus points if you can tie business value to strategic capabilities to justify the investments in technology.
7. Advice:
	* - Create a roadmap and identify the lowest effort for highest return project; 
	- Get budget and hire the resource you need to deliver it well and quickly; 
	- Tell the story loudly and widely as to the value realised upon delivery (uplift in ARR, LTV benefits, productivity gains etc); 
	- Leverage the credit to get approval for permanent recruits.
8. Tip:
	* Start small, deliver one high-impact win, and use that to earn trust (and resources) for the bigger vision.
  
9. Advice"
	* focus less on building everything and more on building a single source of truth first.  
	* When every stakeholder is pulling from the same unified data set, three things happen fast:
		* The credibility of data goes up (no more competing dashboards).  
		* Communication across teams improves because people are literally speaking the same language.  
		* Leadership sees the value quicker, which makes it easier to get buy-in for resources and headcount.  
10. Golden Advice:
	* My 2 cents: Start with c-suite manual excel reports already adjusted to stakeholder lens, biggest goldmine in shortest time. Quickly build political capital and business domain/nuance understanding fast. Q1 goal of sorts. Hope that makes sense. Let me know if you have questions.
11. Advice:
	* First thing I would do is connect with the person(s) that can validate and prioritize business drivers. I'd take them through a value/feasibility exercise and land on a top 3 list for me to focus on. This helps manage expectations as the last thing I'd want to do is spread myself so thin that nobody is happy. Ultimately, this approach will shine a light on the likely resource constraint.
12. Advice:
	* What stands out to me is the importance of identifying what truly matters to the company and being able to answer the "where" and "how" questions clearly.
	* Every company uses data in some way, but often the ultimate goal is increased revenue. At the end of the day, building infrastructure that doesn’t contribute to that goal can become redundant or even infinite in scope without purpose(Qinfinite).
	* Sometimes, it’s more valuable to recognize what isn’t necessary than to keep building things for the sake of it. And when something is needed, being able to start from even the smallest part of it seems to be key.
