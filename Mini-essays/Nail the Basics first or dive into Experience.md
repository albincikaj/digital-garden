The main idea of this discussion is to make a comparison of pros and cons of different approaches that would be suitable to follow while learning a new skill or tool.

Having started from the first principles approach, everything you build up can have a solid structure and you can easily trace back where the gaps or the problems appear while doing a project. This approach provides you with a blueprint of the procedures that you have to follow in order to realize the project in the first place. 
The only problem with this approach is that you are constraint to follow the procedures and sometimes can be time-consuming. 

When diving into experience first you have the possibility to fail a lot faster, so you have faster feedback. The idea is to finish the project first and when you hit the wall you go back and learn the basics. This approach gives you more exposure to new ideas and you will get to use your problem solving skills more often because most of the procedures are failing in the first place. 

The problem arose when I was starting to learn about machine learning and I started to learn statistics first. The approach seemed fun at the beginning but I got bored along the way and I ditched the process all together. 

One other argument that I would like to include is that probably you won't have so much time at hand to learn everything from the basics, because of the time constraints that you have. You won't have that big chunk of time that you can utilize to be an expert at something.
